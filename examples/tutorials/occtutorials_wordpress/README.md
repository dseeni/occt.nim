## Chapter 1.4 
https://github.com/lvk88/OccTutorial/blob/master/Chapter1_Basics/runners/chapter1_4.cpp

This example demonstrates the usage of OpenCASCADE's built-in
optimization algorithms. In this example, we fit a circle onto a 
scattered set of points, using math_BFGS. Check out LeastSquaresFitting.hpp
for more details.
