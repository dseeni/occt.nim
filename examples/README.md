# Examples
Here I'd like to point out to some webs where there are OpenCascade tutorials.

I'd like to get some of those tutorials implemented in Nim.

Feel free to contribute!

## Alternative API
I'd like to provide an alternative API more inspired by [RepliCAD](https://replicad.xyz/), [CADquery](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery) and [CQparts](https://cqparts.github.io/). Some examples:

- [RepliCAD examples](https://replicad.xyz/docs/examples/simple-vase)

- [CqParts examples](https://cqparts.github.io/#examples)
